[X] - Fix: entity abstract class is weird. better call it a thing from which items, player and creatures inherit. Then also have an abstract class called MovingThings from which only player and creatures inherit and get their movement from there. (Jairo)
[] - Fix: Class diagram architecture is not reflecting codebase, as expected, would be nice if we fix it to avoid confusions and include the definitive methods and attributes that are already there. 
[X] - (Will actively work on it every week) Fix: Tasks and their timelines are poorly designed (Some are short and multiple could be combined into 1 but take "1 week"), others are a big part of the project but apparently are missing (Physics Service Hello??), would be good to fix this before continuing with the project. (Everyone)
